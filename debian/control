Description: Python-to-Javascript Compiler that allows you to run python code in browsers
 Pyjaco can translate most standard python code into javascript.
 It comes with an implementation of the majority of the python
 builtin library, with all the standard data types such as iter,
 str, bool, int, dict, list, etc. It also has standard functions
 such as enumerate, zip, sorted, len, dir, cmp, repr, etc.
