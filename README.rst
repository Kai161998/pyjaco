    cd py2js
    make

Examples
--------

firefox examples/gol.html

And the game of life should show in the browser. If it doesn't, it's a bug. You
can generate that file using

python examples/gol.py > examples/gol.html

Tests
-----

./run_tests.py

Will run all tests, that are supposed to work. If any test fails, it's a bug.

./run_tests.py -a

Will run all tests including those that are known to fail (currently). It
should be understandable from the output.

./run_tests.py -x
or
./run_tests.py --no-error

Will run tests but ignore if a error is raised by the test. This is not 
effecting the error generated by the test files in the tests directory.

For more flags then described here

./run_tests.py -h
