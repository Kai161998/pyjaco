An example of using pyjaco to build a stand-alone javascript file that can be
included with HTML. I like this method as it allows separating javascript from
HTML and can therefore be used with a variety of backend setups.

First run the following command in the main pyjaco directory:

# python generate_library.py

This will create the py-builtins.js that is included in the index.html file

Next, generate the clicker.js javascript from clicker.py:

python pyjs.py -N --output clicker.js 

Now you can load index.html in a browser and click the heading for a simple
jQuery interaction.
